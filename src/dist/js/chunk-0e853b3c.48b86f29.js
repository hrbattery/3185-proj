Ruži´c and Pi˘zurica [15] proposed a patch-based method consisting of searching the well-matched patch in the texture component using Markov random field (MRF). Jin and Ye [16] proposed a patch-based approach based on annihilation property filter and low rank structured matrix. In order to remove an object from an image, Kawai et al.

CNNs are used specifically in order to improve the expected results in this field using large-scale training data. The sequentialbased methods succeed in some parts of image inpainting like filling texture details with promising results, yet the problem of capturing the global structure is still a challenging task [46]. Several methods have been proposed for image inpainting using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or encoder-decoder network based on CNN. Shift-Net based on U-Net architecture is one of these methods that recover the missing block with good accuracy in terms of structure and fine-detailed texture [46]. In the same context, Weerasekera et al. [47] use depth map of the image as input of the CNN architecture, whereas Zhao et al. [48] use the proposed architecture for inpainting X-ray medical images. VORNet [49] is another CNN-based approach for video inpainting for object removal. Most image inpainting methods know the reference of damaged pixels of blocks. Cai et al. [50] proposed a blind image inpainting method named (BICNN). Based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using encoder-decoder network structure many works have been proposed for image inpainting. Zhu et al. [51] proposed a patch-based inpainting method for forensics images. Using the same technique of encoder-decoder network, Sidorov and Hardeberg [52] proposed an architecture for denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution for noised, inpainted and low-resolution images, respectively. Zeng et al. [53] built a pyramidal-context architecture called PEN-NET for high-quality image inpainting. Liu et al. [54] proposed a layer to the encoder-decoder network called coherent semantic attention (SCA) layer for image inpainting method. This proposed architecture is presented in Fig. 3. Further, Pathak et al. [55] proposed encoder-decoder model for image inpainting. In order to fill the gap between lines drawing in an image, Sasaki et al. [56] used an encoder-decoder-based model. This work can be helpful for scanned data that can miss some parts. For the UAV data that can be affected in terms of resolution or containing some blindspots, Hsu et al. [57] proposed a solution using VGG architecture. Also, for removing some text from the images Nakamura et al. [58] proposed a text erasing method using CNN. In order to enhance the images of the damaged artwork, Xiang et al. [59] also proposed a CNN-based method. In the same context as [59] and using GRNN neural network, Alilou and Yaghmaee [60] proposed a non-texture image inpainting method. Unlike the previous methods, Liao et al. [61] proposed a method called Artist-Net for image inpainting. The same goal is reached by Cai et al. [62] who proposed a semantic object removal approach using CNN architecture. In order to remove motifs from single images, Hertz et al. [63] proposed a CNN-based approach. Table 2 summarizes the CNN-based methods with a description of the type of data used for image inpainting. For the same purpose of image inpainting, but for replacing a region of an image by another region from another image, the authors in [64] based on VGG model trained their own model. In order to mitigate the effect of the gradient disappearance, the authors in [65] introduce a dense block for U-Net architecture that is used for inpainting the images. For medical purposes, the authors in [67] attempted to denoising the medical images using the principle of image inpainting using Residual U-Net architecture. To address the blurring and color discrepancy problems for image inpainting the authors in [66] proposed a method for missed region reconstruction using region-wise convolutions.

At present, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) becomes the most used technique in all computer vision applications. GAN-based approaches use a coarse-to-fine network and contextual attention module gives good performance and is proven to be helpful for inpainting [71–75]. Existing image inpainting methods based on GAN are generally a few. Out of these, we find that in [71], Chen and Hu proposed a GAN-based semantic image inpainting method, named progressive inpainting, where a pyramid strategy from a low-resolution image to a higher one is performed for repairing the image. For handwritten images, Li et al. [72] proposed a method for inpainting and recognition of occluded characters. The methods use improved GoogLeNet and deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). In an image inpainting method named PEPSI [76] the authors unify the two-stage cascade network of the coarse-to-fine network into a single-stage encoder-decoder network. Where PEPSI++ is the extended version of PEPSI [73]. In [74] the authors used Encoder-decoder network and multi-scale GAN for image inpainting. The same combination is used in [75] for image inpainting and image-to-image transformation purposes. On the RBG-D images, Dhamo et al. [77] used CNN and GAN model to generate the background of a scene by removing the object in the foreground image as performed by many methods of motion detection using background subtraction [78,79]. In order to complete the missing regions in the image, Vitoria et al. [80] proposed an improved version of the Wasserstein GAN with the incorporation of Discriminator and Generator architecture.

The first model attempt to provide an edge completion component and the second one, inpaint the RGB image. According to the fact that GAN-based image inpainting models do not care out to the consistency of the structural and textural values between the inpainted region and their neighboring, the authors in [88] attempts to handle this limitation by providing a GAN model for learning the alignment between the block around the restored region and the original region. For the same reason as [88], taking into consideration the semantic consistency between restored images and original images, Li et al.

When the inpainting network discovers the segmentation information of the input images, the discriminative network discovers the regularizations of the overall realness and segmentation consistency with the originals images.
